# The Visitor Design Pattern in Python

The Visitor pattern lets you define a new operation without changing the classes of the elements on which it operates. It achieves this by separating the algorithm from the object structure, allowing you to add new operations easily. The Visitor pattern embodies the open/closed principle, which states that software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.

Here's how it works:
- **Visitor Interface:** Defines a visit method for each concrete element in the object structure.
- **Concrete Visitor:** Implements the visitor interface and defines the operation to be performed on each element.
- **Element Interface:** Defines an accept method that accepts a visitor.
- **Concrete Elements:** Implement the element interface and define the accept method to accept a visitor.
- **Object Structure:** A collection of elements that can be iterated over, allowing the visitor to visit each element.


## Implementation
Below is a Python implementation of the Visitor pattern using a motorsport example, complete with detailed comments.

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

# Visitor Interface
class CarPartVisitor(ABC):
    """
    The Visitor interface declares a set of visiting methods for each type of
    concrete element in the object structure.
    """
    @abstractmethod
    def visit_engine(self, engine: 'Engine') -> None:
        pass

# Concrete Visitor
class MaintenanceVisitor(CarPartVisitor):
    """
    Concrete Visitors implement several versions of the same algorithm, which can
    work with all concrete element classes.
    """
    def visit_engine(self, engine):
        print(f"Performing maintenance on the engine: {engine.check_engine()}")

# Element Interface
class CarPart(ABC):
    """
    The Element interface declares an `accept` method that takes the base visitor interface.
    """
    @abstractmethod
    def accept(self, visitor):
        pass

# Concrete Element: Engine
class Engine(CarPart):
    """
    Concrete Elements provide implementations of the `accept` method that calls
    the visitor's method corresponding to the element's class.
    """
    def accept(self, visitor):
        # The visitor's visit_engine method is called with this engine instance
        visitor.visit_engine(self)

    def check_engine(self):
        # Specific functionality of the Engine element
        return "Engine is running smoothly."




# Client Code
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Create a car part
    race_engine = Engine()
    # Perform maintenance by accepting the visitor
    race_engine.accept(MaintenanceVisitor())

```
